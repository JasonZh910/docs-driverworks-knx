## KNX\_READ\_REQUEST

This command is sent from the KNX network driver (KNX Routing Gateway or KNX Network) to a KNX driver when a read request is received for a registered Group Address which was previously registered with a [AddGroupItem][1] command.

###### Available from 8.0


### Parameters

function EX_CMD.KNX_READ_REQUEST(tParams)
  local groupID = trim(tParams["GROUP_ADDRESS"])

  end
end
