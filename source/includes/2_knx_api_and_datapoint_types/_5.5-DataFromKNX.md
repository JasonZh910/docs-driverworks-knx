## DATA\_FROM\_KNX

This command is sent from the KNX network driver (KNX Routing Gateway or KNX Network) to a KNX driver when data is received from KNX for a registered Group Address which was previously registered with a [AddGroupItem][1] command.

###### Available from 8.0


### Parameters

| Parameters  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GROUP_ADDRESS` | This is the KNX Group Address associated with the data that is received from the KNX. |
| `RESPONSE` | Specifies if the received data is a response to a read request. |


Note that all other parameters representing data from the KNX are dependent on the DPT being used as specified in the [AddGroupItem][2] command.


### Example

To the right is an example of a `DATA_FROM_KNX` handler of the KNX Switch driver. The driver previously registered a Group Address specified in the Status Address property with the [AddGroupItem][3] command.


```lua
function EX_CMD.DATA_FROM_KNX(tParams)
  local groupID = trim(tParams["GROUP_ADDRESS"])
  local value = tonumber(tParams["VALUE"])
  if (not groupID) or (not value) then return end

  if (groupID == Properties["Status Address"]) then
    if IsStatusInverted() then
      value = ((value > 0) and 0) or 1
    end

    if (value > 0) then
      gLightLevel = 100
    else
      gLightLevel = 0
    end
    SetProxyLightLevel()
  end
end
```
