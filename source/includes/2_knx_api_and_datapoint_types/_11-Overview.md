## KNX Datapoint Type Overview

The following section lists the Datapoint Types supported in this version of the Control4 KNX SDK. It is important to select the appropriate Datapoint Type. This decision should be based on two important factors: 

1. What value(s) does your KNX device expect to receive?
2. What format do those values need to be in?

Knowledge of the device you are creating a driver for is important as each of the Datapoint Types differ in value and value formatting. This section is meant to be used as a reference only. Each of the Datapoint Types listed below is outlined in detail in the following document provided by KNX: _KNX System Specification Internetworking Datapoint Types.Â _
