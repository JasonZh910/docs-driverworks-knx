## Adding the KNX Routing Gateway Driver

The first step in including KNX certified devices into your Control4 project is the inclusion of the KNX Routing Gateway driver. The Routing Gateway driver serves as a layer between the KNX modules and the control devices (dimmers, switch, keypad.) in your project. It handles the parsing of commands sent from the devices and passes them on via Ethernet connection to the KNX modules. Similarly, it handles communication from the modules to the control devices.

The driver uses the KNXnet/IP Routing protocol. As this is a IP multicast protocol, all KNXNet/IP routing devices on local network need to be setup to perform multicast routing whether using a single KNXNet/IP router or multiple. In addition, the network connecting the Control4 master controller and KNXNet/IP devices needs to properly support multicast and not filter the multicast routing address and port used in KNX configuration.

The KNXNet/IP Router devices need to be configured to not filter Group Addresses used by Control4 drivers. For most KNXNet/IP Routers this can be achieved in the following ways:

- Add Group Addresses used by Control4 drivers to KNXNet/IP Router filter tables in the ETS. In ETS5, this can be achieved by:
	- Selecting ‘Pass through Line Coupler’ option in the ‘Properties’ view of a Group Address, or
	- Adding Group Addresses (or Group Address Ranges) to ‘Manual Filter Table Entries’ in the ‘Properties -\> Information’ view of the KNX Line.
- Configure the KNXNet/IP Router to route all group telegrams without considering filter table settings (most routers have the ‘Route’ option in ETS parameter setting). Please note that this option should be used with caution for installations with two or more KNX lines, since passing all group telegrams could lead to increased data traffic on the KNX lines.

Refer to your KNXNet/IP device's manual for more information on how to setup the multicast routing.

The preferred path in implementing KNX within Composer Pro is to add the KNX Routing Gateway driver to your project PRIOR to adding any KNX device drivers that you wish to control or monitor in your system. By adding the Routing Gateway driver first, all of the KNX device drivers subsequently added will be automatically bound correctly to the Routing Gateway driver in the Connections area of Composer Pro.

Any KNX device drivers added to the project prior to the KNX Routing Gateway driver will need to be manually bound in the Connections area of Composer Pro.

In the above example, the KNX Routing Gateway driver has been added to the project. Configuration points provided under Properties page include:

**KNX Minimum Delay (ms):** This is an editable time value that ranges from 25 to 500 milliseconds. This setting is the amount of time the driver will wait after receiving data from the KNX system before sending a KNX messages on the network.  Messages will never be sent to the KNX Network faster than this time allows.

**KNX Maximum Delay (ms):** This is an editable time value that ranges from 50 to 500 milliseconds. This setting is the time allotted for a KNX command to be sent. For example, consider a Control4 project that has 10 KNX light switches. A lighting scene is configured to turn off all of the lights with the push of a keypad button. If the KNX delay value is set to 100 milliseconds, at most each off command will be sent at 100 millisecond intervals. The first command will be sent immediately upon the button push, followed by the second OFF command 100 milliseconds later and so on until all 10 OFF commands are sent.

**KNX Multicast Address:** This settings is the multicast address used by the installed KNX system for multicast communication. It defaults to 224.0.23.12, which is the officially registered IP multicast address for the KNX Association.

**KNX Multicast Port:** Default is 3671. This setting is the multicast port used by the installed KNX system for multicast communication. It defaults to 3671, which is the officially registered IP port for the KNX Association. Any networking changes that modify the default port value must be reflected here.

**Use KNX Individual Address:** This settings specifies if a KNX Individual Address will be assigned to Control4 system. This settings is useful for diagnostics purposes. If this property is set to Yes, All KNX message sent by this driver will have a source address. This address will be visible in the ETS Group Monitor tool making it easier to trace KNX messages sent from this driver. If this property is set to “No”, KNX messages will have the source individual address of a KNX IP router.

**KNX Individual Address:** This setting represents a “dummy” individual address that will be used as a source address for all messages sent by the driver and will be visible in the ETS Group Monitor tool. This should be an address of a “dummy” device on the backbone line (0.0.x). This property is visible only if Use KNX Individual Address property is set to Yes.


The Actions tab can be useful when trouble shooting or testing the KNX devices in your project.

**Display Globals:** This button will display a list of all global values associated with the driver. This is particularly useful when debugging drivers.

**Display Group Addresses:** This button will display a list of all of the Group Address that the KNX Routing gateway driver is aware of. The addresses are displayed with their associated Datapoint and Group ID values.
